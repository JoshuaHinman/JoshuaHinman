Hello and welcome to my Github! I am a long-time programming enthusiast, with experience in Javascript, Ruby and C++.  I have spent the last five years studying and practicing software engineering, focusing on back and front-end web development.  I love using Node and React, and am currently learning cloud services with AWS.
